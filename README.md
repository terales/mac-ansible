mac-ansible
===========

I use this project to configure my macOS the way I like it. That way I can wipe
and re-install with less effort.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) with the command from the site
2. `brew install python`
3. `brew install git`
4. `pip3 install ansible` (always the best way to install Ansible)
5. `git clone https://github.com/terales/mac-ansible.gitz
6. `cd mac-ansible`
7. `ansible-playbook ./playbook.yml`
