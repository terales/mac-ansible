mac-ansible
===========

I use this project to configure my macOS the way I like it. That way I can wipe
and re-install with less effort. See my
[blog post](https://adamj.eu/tech/2019/03/20/how-i-provision-my-macbook-with-ansible/).

Getting Started
---------------

1. Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) with the command from the site
2. `brew install python`
3. `brew install git`
4. `pip3 install ansible` (always the best way to install Ansible)
5. Then `./playbook.yml`

Fork! Copy! Adapt!
